An adapter is an abstraction that interacts with the database driver directly. It contains low-level functions like `exec` to execute a raw query.

Kineo, currently, only has one built-in adapter: the Neo4j adapter. SQL adapters are being worked on.

## The Neo4j Adapter

:::note
Nothing in this section is associated with Neo4j. Kineo is a separate project, with no affiliation.

This section assumes you have some knowledge of the Neo4j JavaScript driver.
:::

```ts
import { Neo4jAdapter } from "kineo/adapter/neo4j";
```

The Neo4j adapter requires that you install `neo4j-driver`.

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add neo4j-driver
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install neo4j-driver --save
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add neo4j-driver
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add neo4j-driver
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="deno">
    :::caution
    Deno support is experimental. Make sure to run Kineo with correct Node.js compatibility options, and to install from npm as `neo4j-driver` is not on JSR.
    :::

    ```bash
    deno add npm:neo4j-driver
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The adapter itself takes in an object containing options. You can either pass:

- an object with a `driver` key, containing a driver from `neo4j-driver`, and an optional `session` key, containing a session from the driver or a session configuration.
- an object with `url`, containing the url to the database, `auth` containing authentication options, and optionally, `session`, containing session configuration.

```ts
Neo4jAdapter({ driver, session });
Neo4jAdapter({ url, auth, session });
```

- `url`: A `string` containing your database URL.
- `auth`: An `Auth` object containing authentication options. Can be one of:
  - `type: "basic"`:
    - `username: string`,
    - `password: string`,
    - `realm?: string`.
  - `type: "bearer"`: `token: string`.
  - `type: "kerberos"`: `ticket: string`.
  - `type: "custom"`:
    - `principal: string`,
    - `credentials: string`,
    - `realm: string`,
    - `scheme: string`,
    - `params: Record<string, any>`.
- `session`: A `neo4j-driver` `SessionConfig` object.

And that's it for adapters! Check [the guide for creating your own adapter](/guides/create-adapter) or [the Adapter API reference](/api/adapter) for more details.
