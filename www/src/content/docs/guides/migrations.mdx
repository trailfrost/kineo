Kineo comes with a built-in migration manager CLI. It's called KineoKit, but you can only run it by `kineo` and not `kineokit`.

This page will only focus on the migration management side of KineoKit. For the initialization command, check [the Quick Start guide](/guides/quick-start/#the-init-command).

## The `push` command

The `push` command skips migrations entirely, and pushes the schema to the database.

**Options**:
- `--force, -f`: Ignores any warnings. **This may cause data loss.**

## The `pull` command

The `pull` command generates a schema based on your database's current schema. **Not all databases support this command.**

**Options**:
- `--force, -f`: Ignores any warnings. **This will replace your current schema in your code.**

## The `generate` and `migrate` commands

These are aliases for each other. They generate migrations, and unless otherwise specified, deploys them.

**Options**:
- `--no-push, -n`: Don't deploy migrations, only generate them.

## The `status` command

The `status` command gets the status of all migrations. Where this status is stored depends on the adapter -- all the built-in store them in your database.

## The `create` command

The `create` command creates a migration file.

**Options**:
- `--name, -n`: The name of the migration file.

## The `deploy` command

The `deploy` command deploys migrations that haven't been deployed yet.

## The `rollback` command

The `rollback` command reverts the last n migrations.

**Arguments**:
- n (first argument): The number of migrations to roll back.

And that's it for KineoKit! Check [the KineoKit API Reference](/api/kit) for more details.
