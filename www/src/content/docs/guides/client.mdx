Clients are the piece of glue between your schema and your database. They construct classes based on your schema, allowing you to call methods to interact with your database.

To create a client, you can import from `kineo/client`.

```ts
import { Kineo } from "kineo/client";
```

The `Kineo` function returns a client. It takes in an [adapter](/guides/adapter) and a [schema](/guides/schema).

```ts
import { MyAdapter } from "./my-adapter";
import { schema } from "./schema";

export const client = Kineo(
  MyAdapter(),
  schema,
);
```

That's it! You will be able to access methods such as `client.User.findFirst`, if you have a model named `User` on your schema. Check [the Client API reference](/api/client) for more details.

Keep in mind that not all adapters will make all model methods available. For example, the built-in SQL adapters don't support `connect`, as that's specific to graph databases, so it won't be available on `client.User`.
