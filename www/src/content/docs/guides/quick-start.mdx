import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Kineo is a TypeScript library for interacting with your database. To install it, you can use the following commands:

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add kineo
    pnpm exec kineo init
    ```

    The package will be added to your package.json
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install kineo --save
    npx kineo init
    ```

    The package will be added to your package.json
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add kineo
    yarn run kineo init
    ```

    The package will be added to your package.json
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add kineo
    bunx kineo init
    ```

    The package will be added to your package.json
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="deno">
    :::caution
    Deno support is experimental. Make sure to run Kineo with correct Node.js compatibility options, and install from npm as it's currently not on JSR.
    :::

    ```bash
    deno add npm:kineo
    deno run npm:kineo init
    ```

    The package will be added to your deno.json or package.json.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## The `init` command

Kineo's `init` command will ask you a few questions and generate a `kineo.config.ts` file.

- **Where is your client located?** (`--client-file`): Where your client is located (e.g. `src/db/client.ts`). The file will be created if it doesn't exist.
- **What is the name of the export of your client?** (`--client-export`): The name of the export of your client (e.g. `default`, `client`). A default client will be created if it doesn't exist.
- **Where is your schema located?** (`--schema-file`): Where your schema is located (e.g. `src/db/schema.ts`). The file will be created if it doesn't exist.
- **What is the name of the export of your schema?** (`--schema-export`): The name of the export of your schema (e.g. `default`, `schema`). A default schema will be created if it doesn't exist.
- **Where do you want your migrations to be stored?** (`--migrations-dir`): The directory you want your migrations to be generated in (e.g. `./migrations`). The directory will be created if it doesn't exist.

And there it is! Kineo has been successfully set up in your project. You can start by [adding a schema](/guides/schema), [adding a client and adapter](/guides/client), or [running some migrations](/guides/migrations).
